    <h1>Vegan Pizza</h1>

    <h2>How can you tell a pizza is vegan?</h2>
    <p>
        Starting off this wonderful recipe with one of our favorite jokes. At this point 
        I suppose I have to talk about a story about me and pizza and how it's changed
        my file because most recipes on the internet seems to do so. But who I am to bore
        you with such details!
    </p>
    <p>
        There's nothing special about a vegan pizza except it lacks cheese & any other 
        animal products. The main problem with vegan cheese alternatives is that they are 
        really location dependent. That's why I won't go into details about brands. Any of 
        them will do. You probably don't want to use too much of it though.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Flour (High Protein Type 00) | 500 gr</li>
        <li>Water | 325 gr</li>
        <li>Salt | 15 gr</li>
        <li>Dry Yeast | 0.3 gr</li>
        <li>Tomato Sauce | 250 gr</li>
        <li>Olive Oil | 50 gr (oven dependant)</li>
        <li>Vegan Cheese (optional) | 180 gr</li>
        <li>Your topping of choice (optional)</li>
    </ul>
 
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the salt to the water and mix about 50 grams of flour to protect the yeast from salt in the next step.</li>
        <li>Mix in the yeast. Let it rest about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>If ypur oven can't reach 400-500 °C, it's important to add some olive oil to the dough to keep it from drying during baking.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining flour, mix with a spoon until you can't. </li>
        <li>Knead the dough for about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Let the dough rest about 24h.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven.</li>
        <li>Shape the dough with your hands.</li>
        <li>Add some homemade tomato sauce. If you don't know how to prepare it, you can use canned tomatoes or 
            <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=tomato+sauce+recipe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">search online</a> for a recipe.</li>
        <li>All the toppings go on top and the pizza goes into the oven. If the oven reaches a maximum temperature of 250 °C it'll need about 10 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
